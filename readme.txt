DeathStarGame
the game, multiplayer, ever non-commercial money-free program

DeathStarGame is ever any-money-concerns-free program, openly created and contributed
it's not a org, not a project, not a namespace - it's just a program
no funds, no pots, purely volunteer creating process, no strings attached or hidden
DeathStarGame is a children's playground, an inspiration-driven development
we are bulding a spacious, epic, designed for e-sports, yet elegant and simple game for players to perform, somehting Jesus would play

- designed for e-sports, for players to perform -  quality over quantity, a match is an event
- no noise and distructions - only the game to play
- thinking over micro/mechanics: players use programming language to complete scenarios' objectives
- DeathStarGame is exclusively a 1v1 game
- one game, not many scenarios, a sport, designed for players to perform - one game, one of, like basketball, tennis, starcraft
- simple, complete, finite - like tennis, football, basketball, Broodwar, Battle Toads - without updates, unlike AoE2 where many civs have many details that keep on changing
- matches: like in tennis or big starcraft/aoe2 torunaments, or basketball - players play a match a day, bo5/bo7, give a performance
- match duration time is like in tennis - not fixed
- game comes with no ladder - only host and connect
- no chat in the program, only the game
- no usernames in the game - only colors
- game is not global, nor decentralized - users host and connect as usual, program stores data locally only, on user computer it runs on
- installation: desktop program
- players use a programming language to build/create a composition/solution within a game
- maps are randomly generated at the start, but there will be no randomness afterwards, players are always in equal position, there will be no RNG-complaints
- players can evaluate code interactively in the REPL to explore resource and solution space
- players have a real language to express logic, not just clicks and hotkeys
- game is designed not for fast-typer-wins, but for clearer-thinker-wins
- game is game only, no tournament creation
- language: clojure
- no docs: just the program and readme with goal and compile
- no tests
- runtime: JVM, no GraalVM compilation
- gui: cljfx
- db: datahike
- repository has no releases of binaries, only source code and build from source
- build tool: jpackage, build is done with one cli command
- JVM is downloaded into repo's dir for use by build or run
- program can be run from source with one cli command
- repo has no issues, repo is code only
- no attribution headers in files: repo is code only
- no programmer names: repo is code only
- no license files: repo is code only
- no authors: repo is code only
- no releases: commit hashes define the program
- no update notifications
- one branch - main, forks, no git tags
- rebase or merge - merge
- forbidden words: refactor, fix, update, util, helper, play with, controller/manager, factory, wrap, etc, misc, cleanup, service, org, todo, archive, trash, maintainer, test, alpha
- no nesting: all files are flat on one level - src/DeathStarGame
- pull requests on github, but merge from command line, no programmer names - --ff or 'from fork/main into upstream/main'
- no programmer names or emails in commit history: repo is code only
- no public programmers: repo is code only
