## format is a fun emotional entertaining journey documentary


- projects lack coverage accessible/understandable by unaware viewer as well, emotions, personalities, the sense of the journey that is definately there during creation/development
- plus, we, as undertakers of the journey, would benefit from speaking out in public, bringing the process to public eye, yet doing it within a watchable format (hopelfully enjoyable)
- for years the question was: how to bring to public eye the process behind the project, in an entertaining manner?
- the previous idea was creating animated series
    - but, animated series is a project of their own
- how do we shed light and focus on actual project?
- in documentary style, a journey, that takes place in mind and on the screen, rather than geographically, but still the same thing
- the journey happens all the time, on the screen of computer, in the internet, plus some shots from real world to enrich the story
- the format is that of a documentary episode, but with emotions and jokes etc.
    - there is narration
    - there are shots (fragments) of speaking on camera, or the camera is placed in the corner as on stream
    - mainly, the screen shows what is needed to explain/present visually information, anything from the internet, editor (code, quotes,videos,websites, comparisons - anything)
    - anything to make the point, convey the idea, show the journey/exploration/struggle as it happens
    - the point is: use what is already on screen and on camera to cut a video, add narration (on camera when needed, with gestures)
- cut the real events, thoughts, research, internet exploration into a video episode
- this format
    - is completely about the project, authentic and
    - is unlimited (as anyhthing can be used already for the video)
    - is direct and understandable, yet can be made dynamic and entertaining
    - it allows (in the future) for interviews and guests
    - and it has characters - project developers  - already on camera (when needed), as actors, it is straightforward and "connected"
- for example
    - existing game experience can be showcased (what it means to launch, down)
    - what it means to make as extension or as one-app
    - ... etc.
- so anyhting can be recorded on sreen, cut into a video, narrated and presented as a video without any graphical work (only optionally, on later stages as a cherry on the cake)
