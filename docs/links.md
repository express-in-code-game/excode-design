#### blender is a no-option

- custom nowhere else used ui in a low level language cannot allow virant development of video editor
- the complexity of target functionality of such software is enough in itself, not upgrading to modern ui means tight coupling
- just think about it: software exists for years, and they never implemented the next version using better technologies
- so it does what it does, but this edition is a legacy/classic
- video editor requires a fresh approach overall, users should be able to use prpogramming language and version control along with ui
- but as it currently (2020) stands, all video editors are completely GUI based, and that should be embraced
- given that, a better/simpler editor that is popular and widely used should be picked, so that there are examples/guides on how to edit videos
